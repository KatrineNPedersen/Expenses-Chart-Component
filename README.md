- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to incorporate a local JSON file to dynamically generate the bars and their labels based on the data. I was also able to create a much better structure using CSS grid for the daily spend bar graph

### Continued development

I will continue to work on integrating JSON files, as well as CSS grid in future challenges where applicable.

### Useful resources

- [JSON Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OhMbf2v_jI) - This video was incredibly well explained and proved to be a great introduction to JSON and provided me with the necessary information to incorporate a local JSON file into the challenge.
